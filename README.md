# Advance-Kernel-Methods-for-Machine-Learning
Kernel methods are awesome tools for tackling tough nonlinear machine learning problems, like predicting or sorting curvy data. This thesis uses functional analysis, a math subject, to explain these methods, focusing on ideas like Mercer’s Theorem and special spaces called Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). We make these ideas clear and show how they work in real life, mixing math with coding experiments in Python. First, we look at simple methods—like basic regression for prediction, clustering for grouping things, and classification for sorting items—to understand each problem. Then, we dive into kernel versions: Kernel Ridge Regression, Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA), Kernel K-Means Clustering, Kernel Logistic Regression, Kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). For Logistic Regression and Kernel Logistic Regression, we use the Newton-Raphson method to update solutions faster, instead of usual ways. For GPR, we use Cholesky decomposition to solve matrix inverses quickly, giving smart guesses with confidence. Using Python, we tested these on datasets: Two Moons, Two Circles, Spiral, and Breast Cancer datasets of Python. Two Moons and Spiral show how kernel methods handle tricky shapes, while Breast Cancer tests predictions. We also tackle issues like slow calculations. Our work blends functional analysis and tests to prove kernel methods beat simple ones, paving the way for better machine learning.
